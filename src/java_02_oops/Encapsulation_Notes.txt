ENCAPSULATION IN JAVA (Interview Notes)
====================================

1) What is Encapsulation?
-------------------------
Encapsulation means:
- Wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) together inside a class
- Hiding internal data using 'private'
- Giving controlled access using public methods (getters/setters)

Simple words:
"Data is hidden and can be accessed/modified only through methods."


2) Why do we need Encapsulation?
--------------------------------
Benefits:
1. Data Security / Data Hiding
   - Nobody can directly change important fields.
   Example: balance should not be updated directly.

2. Validation (Business Rules)
   - You can control allowed values.
   Example: age cannot be negative, withdraw cannot exceed balance.

3. Better Maintainability
   - If logic changes, you update it in one place (inside methods).

4. Loose Coupling
   - Other classes don't depend on internal variable structure.

5. Cleaner Design (Industry Standard)
   - Makes code professional and scalable.


3) How to achieve Encapsulation?
--------------------------------
Steps:
1) Make variables private
2) Provide public getters (read)
3) Provide public setters (write) OR better: business methods

Example:
private double balance;

public double getBalance() { return balance; }

public void deposit(double amount) { ... }
public void withdraw(double amount) { ... }


4) Getter vs Setter
-------------------
Getter:
- Used to read private data
- Example: getBalance()

Setter:
- Used to update private data with validation
- Example: setName()

Note:
For sensitive fields (like balance), prefer deposit/withdraw instead of setBalance().


5) Encapsulation vs Abstraction
-------------------------------
Encapsulation:
- Hides data (private fields)
- Controlled access (getters/setters)

Abstraction:
- Hides implementation details
- Shows only essential features (interfaces/abstract classes)


6) Common Interview Questions (Quick)
-------------------------------------
Q) What is encapsulation?
A) Data hiding + controlled access using private fields and public methods.

Q) Why make variables private?
A) To prevent direct modification and enforce validation.

Q) Is using getter/setter always good?
A) Not always. For business fields, prefer business methods (deposit/withdraw).
