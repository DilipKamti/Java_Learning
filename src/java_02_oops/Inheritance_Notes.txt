INHERITANCE IN JAVA (Interview Notes)
=================================

1) What is Inheritance?
----------------------
Inheritance means one class (child/subclass) acquires properties (fields) and behaviors (methods)
of another class (parent/superclass) using the keyword 'extends'.

Simple words:
- Parent gives common features
- Child reuses + can add its own features

Syntax:
class Child extends Parent { }

Benefits:
- Code reusability
- Less duplication
- Easy maintenance
- Supports Polymorphism (method overriding)


2) Types of Inheritance in Java
-------------------------------

A) Single Inheritance
Parent -> Child

class A { }
class B extends A { }

B) Multilevel Inheritance
A -> B -> C

class A { }
class B extends A { }
class C extends B { }

C) Hierarchical Inheritance
One parent, multiple children

class A { }
class B extends A { }
class C extends A { }

D) Multiple Inheritance (NOT supported using classes)
A + B -> C  (NOT allowed in Java with classes)

class C extends A, B { }  // ❌ Not allowed

E) Hybrid Inheritance (NOT supported using classes)
Combination of multiple types (needs multiple inheritance)
❌ Not supported with classes
✅ Can be achieved using Interfaces


3) Diamond Problem (Very Important)
-----------------------------------
Diamond Problem happens when a class tries to inherit from two classes which both have the same method.

Example idea:
    A
   /   B   C
   \ /
    D

If both B and C have method show(), then D is confused:
Which show() should it call? B's or C's?

Because of this ambiguity:
✅ Java does NOT allow multiple inheritance with classes.


4) How Java solves Multiple Inheritance?
----------------------------------------
Java supports multiple inheritance using Interfaces.

Example:
interface A { default void show() { } }
interface B { default void show() { } }

class C implements A, B {
   @Override
   public void show() {
      // must resolve conflict
      A.super.show();
      B.super.show();
   }
}


5) super keyword
----------------
super is used to access parent class things:
- super()           -> calls parent constructor
- super.methodName() -> calls parent method
- super.variable     -> accesses parent variable


6) Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
-------------------------------------------
Overriding means:
Child class provides its own implementation of a parent method.

Rules:
- Same method name
- Same parameters
- Same return type (or covariant)
- Must be in parent-child relationship

Access modifier rule:
Child method cannot be more restrictive.
(public -> cannot become protected/private)


7) Upcasting (Important)
------------------------
Parent reference can hold child object:

Parent p = new Child();

Runtime method call:
p.overriddenMethod();  // Child version runs

But:
p.childOnlyMethod();   // ❌ not allowed (reference type decides accessible methods)


8) final keyword in inheritance
-------------------------------
- final class -> cannot be extended
- final method -> cannot be overridden


9) Quick Interview One-Liners
-----------------------------
- Java is single inheritance with classes, multiple inheritance via interfaces.
- Inheritance supports code reuse and runtime polymorphism.
- Diamond problem is the reason multiple inheritance with classes is not allowed.

==================================================================================================
🔥 Interview Questions on Inheritance (Very Common)
✅ Q1) What is inheritance?

➡️ Reusing parent class properties/methods in child class.

✅ Q2) Types of inheritance in Java?

➡️ Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical
Multiple & Hybrid not supported using classes (supported using interfaces).

✅ Q3) Why Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes?

➡️ Because of Diamond Problem ambiguity.

✅ Q4) What is Diamond Problem?

➡️ When two parent classes have same method and child gets confused which one to call.

✅ Q5) Can we achieve multiple inheritance in Java?

➡️ Yes using Interfaces.

✅ Q6) What is method overriding?

➡️ Child class provides its own implementation of parent method.

✅ Q7) Difference between Overloading and Overriding?
Feature				Overloading			Overriding
Compile/Runtime			Compile time			Runtime
Same class?			Yes				Parent-child
Params				Different			Same
Polymorphism			Compile-time			Runtime
✅ Q8) What is super?

➡️ Used to call parent constructor/method/variable.
