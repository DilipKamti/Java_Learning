CLASS AND OBJECT IN JAVA (Interview Notes)
====================================

1) What is a Class?
-------------------
A class is a blueprint/template that defines:
- Data (fields/variables)
- Behavior (methods)

Example:
Class = Car design
Object = Real car created from that design


2) What is an Object?
---------------------
An object is a real instance of a class.
- It occupies memory in the Heap
- It has its own state (values of fields)
- It can call methods defined in the class


3) How to create an Object?
---------------------------
Syntax:
ClassName ref = new ClassName();

Example:
Car c1 = new Car();

- 'new' allocates memory for object in Heap
- 'c1' is a reference variable stored in Stack


4) Where are objects stored? (Memory)
-------------------------------------
- Object is created in HEAP memory
- Reference variable is stored in STACK memory

Example:
Car c1 = new Car();

Stack:
c1 -> reference/address

Heap:
Car object (brand, speed, methods access)


5) Constructor (Important)
--------------------------
Constructor is a special method used to initialize an object.

Rules:
- Same name as class
- No return type
- Called automatically when object is created

Types:
- Default constructor (provided by Java if none is written)
- Parameterized constructor (created by developer)


6) this keyword
---------------
'this' refers to the current object.
Used when local variables and instance variables have same name.

Example:
this.name = name;


7) Reference Copy (Tricky)
--------------------------
Car c1 = new Car();
Car c2 = c1;

Both c1 and c2 point to SAME object.
Changing using c2 will affect c1 also.


8) null reference
-----------------
Car c = null;
c.drive();  // NullPointerException

Meaning:
Reference exists but object not created.


9) Interview One-Liners
-----------------------
- Class is blueprint, object is instance.
- Objects are stored in heap, references in stack.
- Constructor initializes object state.
